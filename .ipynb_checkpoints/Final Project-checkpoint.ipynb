    "# Final Project \n",
    "\n",
    "Summary |\n",
    "In this project I will be taking macro economic data and corrolating that back to an investment portfolio. This portfolio includes stocks, bonds, and etfs. The portfolio I will be looking at is the NDSU student managed Bison Fund. The Bison Fund has a core satellite strategy that focuses on a passive index investing in the core and activily managed satellite smid strategy. The Fund reports quarterly and in these report include macro economic data impacting their portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Goal |\n",
    "The goal is to be able to analze what 5 indicators are most correlated with the portfolio and what five are most correlated with individual holdings. Then automating the process to do stress test, and sensitivity analysis on the portfolio to see how effective these indicators are at predicting performance. The end product will be pasted in user freindly spreadsheats and PDFs for executives to pull.\n",
